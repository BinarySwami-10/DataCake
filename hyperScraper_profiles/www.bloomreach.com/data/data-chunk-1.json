        "First and foremost the COVID-19 novel coronavirus outbreak is a terrible human tragedy, affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the globe. Living in Seattle as I do - perhaps the first place in North America to really experience the outbreak - you understand how interconnected we are as human beings, and the few degrees of separation we all have from each other.",
        "We all need to acknowledge that steps need to be taken to\u00a0\u201cflatten the curve\u201d\u00a0anywhere there is an outbreak to ensure our healthcare system can keep up and help those who are impacted hopefully recover. That is at the core of the measures China, Italy, and now even\u00a0Washington State\u00a0are taking to try to cope.",
        "And while I know we all hope that these measures - along with treatment protocols and perhaps vaccines - will stem the impact of the virus, unfortunately it appears the impact may be significant and take some time to play out and get under control. Just today the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 novel coronavirus a global\u00a0pandemic.",
        "And businesses of course need to\u00a0plan for many different scenarios\u00a0in times like these.\u00a0",
        "For business leaders this presents a whole host of important questions ranging from employee health, to addressing supply chain disruption, to consumer trust, to business continuity. The impact on the economy and business cycle is of course\u00a0unclear and uncertain. Hopefully those challenges are short term, but for businesses, what are the implications for eCommerce in the short-term and longer-term?",
        "Of course, coronavirus will not just impact how we behave as consumers, it impacts every aspect of our lives - including work. Many employees will be working remote or from home, traveling less (or as I am, grounded), people may work in odd shifts to keep large groups from forming, and certainly people are much less likely to \u2018meet up\u2019 with a salesperson in person.",
        "Businesses are already advising\u00a0no visitors\u00a0to campuses, buildings and factories. And to both drive demand and keep the proverbial machines running, B2B eCommerce will become a very important channel.",
        "Amazon is again a looming threat here, but even for highly specialized B2B manufacturers and distributors online channels and eCommerce is going to play a critical role in the next phase of growth. That was true even before Covid-19 began to have an impact, but is more certainly true now.\u00a0",
        "For businesses everywhere it is time to gameplan to address the long-term implications of the novel coronavirus, and that is most certainly true for B2B companies where digital commerce channels will be critical moving forward.\u00a0",
        "\n\n\u00a0",
        "\nShort term ensure your digital channels are up to date and accurate:\u00a0",
        "\u00a0For relevant products, ensure your product information and content is relevant, fact-based and accurate.\u00a0Customers are depending on you to keep their employees and customers safe. Rich content and\u00a0relevant links\u00a0to medical and scientific authorities may be an important help, and that is true even if you do not sell and market relevant products. And of course ensure your products are discoverable, both through search, but also via cross-sell and content to let customers who do not typically order in these categories know if you carry these items and are in-stock.\u00a0Make sure products are attributed correctly so they appear in the right searches.\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Ensure out of stock items are clearly marked and can not be ordered.\u00a0This seems obvious, but not all systems are as well integrated as they should be. Having these products still appear in search and category listings with \u201csold-out\u201d - and when you expect the back-order or resupply to become available - may be a better service to your customers than simply removing them, as it will save customers time and aggravation. And while it may seem anathema to common business practices, you can also consider the good will of helping customers find these products even if it is from a competitor\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Ensure fair market pricing is followed and delivery promise-dates are accurate.\u00a0This is a particular issue if you run a marketplace or a yield-based pricing system which could bias pricing in a way that is not appropriate now.\u00a0 Not only is this a moral obligation, but also may put you on the wrong side of authorities - lat alone frustrating a customer.",
        "\u00a0Reassure customers on how products will be delivered or fulfilled.\u00a0Companies are naturally becoming very sensitive to visitors to their facilities, and this is especially true for factories, health-care and senior living facilities, schools, production environments, or corporate offices with a large cohort of employees or people on site. What precautions are you taking to keep your products, packaging, and personnel safe? What delivery options and flexibility can you offer? This may be important now to your customers to understand up-front. Don\u2019t make them call to find out, they are busy. Auto-replenishment programs may also need to be adjusted. Either due to closures, slow down in your clients business activity -\u00a0 or on the flip side, stepped up demand for some products.\u00a0",
        "\u00a0And of course\u2026 Consider how your firm can aid in community response.Healthcare and other social services in your area may soon be overwhelmed. There may be ways you can help your communities cope with supplies, technology, expertise, donations, or even logistics support.\u00a0",
        "However, the Medium and Longer-term implications are even more profound. None of us really knows how long or to what extent this situation may be in effect.",
        "\u00a0",
        "\n\u00a0B2B eCommerce is more important than ever.\u00a0While salespeople will still have a role to play in B2B - reaching customers, being top-of mind, and capturing demand as it happens will require B2B\u2019s to execute with excellence in their eCommerce channels and digital marketing efforts.",
        "Some B2B\u2019s are poised to adapt and take advantage of investments they have made in eCommerce and digital marketing. However, many B2Bs are going to be caught flat footed, having delayed investments in the past or shying away from eCommerce due to internal channel conflict. It is time to act now.",
        "Be ready for the call from the C-Suite\u2026 \u201cHow do we double eCommerce and how fast can we do it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0Time to move on and retire that old customer mythology.\u00a0Your customers already spend more time on their smartphones than with their laptops, employees, or loved ones. Guess what, you are competing for their attention against a tidal wave of texts from their boss, Facebook, a market alert, a long list of to-do\u2019s they are behind on, and that funny Conan video Mary in accounting sent out over slack.",
        "They would rather text with you than talk on the phone. Email? You sent an email? You want a meeting? It is time to realize that many B2B companies still suffer with a mythology of how their customers\u00a0want\u00a0to work with them - face to face.",
        "That is of course suspended now. And when it comes to getting the routine done, we want the same efficient tools we get as consumers, and doing things ourselves. That is even more true in this era of \u2018social distancing\u2019.\n\n\u00a0Amazon, aggregators, and large distributors are poised to fill a gap.\u00a0You are now working from home, you need something for your business, where are you going to turn? You already hate your procurement system, and Amazon - or pick your poison - is just easier.",
        "You know when it will arrive and are just going to expense it. The old policies are out the window, because this is not business as usual. This pattern will be repeated hundreds of thousands of times a day.",
        "If your business is without effective digital commerce channels - and a way to reach those customers and digitally engage them - you have a big problem. And once these patterns are set, it will simply be much harder to get them back.",
        "Make no mistake here, Amazon and others are already all over this. And they can leverage buying power and their marketing engine to respond quickly. They already have a significant B2B business, and their marketplace capability enables them to also respond in ways others will be challenged to in part due to capital constraints and cost of inventory.",
        "These changes in customer behavior will be hard to address later, and winning back the share of wallet you loose, even if you do not lose the account, will be expensive. So don\u2019t let it happen if you can help it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Your businesses may face a burning platform.\u00a0If you serve small local businesses\u00a0 such as restaurants, schools, nail salons you may be impacted. If you live in areas already impacted you don\u2019t need me to tell you, this is significant.",
        "If you serve enterprise customers with large considered purchases or capital investments you also likely can see implications as your customers pause to understand the ramifications of this so called\u00a0\u2018black swan\u2019.",
        "We do not know how long that pause will last, but if it is discretionary it is of course at risk. And with the triple-whammy of impacted supply-chains, fluctuating capital markets and\u00a0stock market gyrations, the thin line many businesses have walked in the 11-year expansion since 2009 is now turning pink, if not red.",
        "For many B2B businesses, the foundations of their business models and operations may suddenly have symptoms from the virus as well. With the changes to come - like more workers working from home for example - some businesses need to pivot. For example, from B2B to B2B2E - business to business to (the clients\u2019) employees.",
        "People will invest in their homes (and home offices) and make them as productive as possible. It may be time to pivot toward new product lines, business model, customer engagement and sales, and naturally digital and eCommerce should be central to that.\n\n\u00a0More experimentation in innovative digital experiences.\u00a0With in-person meetings and travel restrictions potentially lasting a while, digital technologies that were largely edge-case ideas may suddenly seem more viable.",
        "There are many emerging digital technologies that may have even more impact on B2B than in the consumer market, and that includes augmented reality (AR) or visual search in a repair scenario where you want to do it yourself versus call in a technician - or they don\u2019t want to come or are not available because they can\u2019t travel or are on quarantine.",
        "Virtual reality (VR) may be a tool for training and \u2018walk-throughs\u2019 that can\u2019t take place in person. Group buying and even more marketplaces for gig-workers of all types may become even more prevalent in a down-cycle. Many of these digital experiments may prove to be unsuccessful, but a few may lead to meaningful efficiency gains or growth opportunities as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0",
        "Finally, it is important to realize that there will be winners here too.\u00a0There is a silver lining there for some to take advantage of - to span the gap and build long-term growth. Those who can adapt fast and leverage digital channels at the core of their business will win.",
        "I look forward to your comments and ideas. Let\u2019s do this together.",

        "Thanks to the web and the Internet of Things (IoT), today\u2019s digital landscape is more focused on the consumer than ever before.\n\nAs more shopping happens outside of the traditional website, such as on mobile, social, or IoT channels, the traditional eCommerce platforms are not nimble enough to adapt to these new touchpoints in a reasonable time.\n\nOrganizations that rely on eCommerce as a core part of their business model need to adapt to keep a competitive edge \u2013 as such, many are transitioning to headless commerce for digital delivery.",
        "\u00a0",
        "In its simplest form, headless commerce\u00a0is an eCommerce solution where the frontend presentation\u00a0(head) has been decoupled from the backend commerce functionality.\u00a0",
        "The frontend or \u201cthe head\u201d - think user interface, social commerce, digital marketplace, IoT and more - can be updated or changed individually, without interfering with the backend.",
        "This essentially provides enterprises more flexibility to create unique experience for your visitors. They can select and customize\u00a0the features and functionalities of their commerce platform.\u00a0",
        "We talked to Dirk Hoerig, CEO at commercetools and a key innovator in the headless commerce platform space, to understand how he understood the term:",

On top of that, a headless eCommerce system can easily connect \u2013 via API \u2013 to any customer experience front-end.",
        "You don\u2019t have \u201csocial\u201d, \u201cweb\u201d or \u201cdisplay\u201d content anymore, you just have content (and data) and it needs to adapt at a moments notice.\u00a0",
        "For a connected experience, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a seperate, siloed tool for each type of interaction.",
        "This is why API-driven platforms, that can connect both new touchpoints and critical legacy systems with microservice wrappers, are rising in popularity as the foundation of this\u00a0experience-based model.",
        "\n",
        "\u00a0",
        "Headless architecture is a subset of decoupled architecture. It is aimed at pushing your data or content to any type of platforms through APIs.",
        "",
        "\nIn headless approach, architecture focuses purely on background processes, making data available to separate frontend applications via commerce APIs.\u00a0The backend - items like infrastructure, pricing, checkout and security - invisibly runs in the background. The frontend and backend speak to each other via simple API calls.",
        "Part of building a headless commerce architecture includes a headless CMS.",
        "From a high-level perspective, a headless CMS for any purpose (including commerce) has distinguishable parts.",
        "The backend database includes different kinds of content such as written copy and images.",
        "However, headless commerce requires a few additional systems compared to headless designs that simply deliver content.",
        "Headless commerce uses a separate inventory management system in conjunction with the backend database that stores the content.",
        "Other backend systems usually include customer relationship management systems (CRMs), payment processing platforms, multi-channel security systems, and others.",
        "Here, the API becomes responsible for pulling information into specific systems after certain actions are complete, rather than just providing content to different channels.",
        "For example, let\u2019s say a user is viewing a product on a mobile browser and makes a purchase.",
        "If they\u2019re a new customer, they would fill out a form which is used to update the business CRM.",
        "Too, this information might come from a platform like PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or some other service to expedite the checkout process.",
        "After the transaction is complete, backend systems are updated by the API calling on data to log the financial exchange, update the inventory system, and store the customer information.",
        "\u00a0",
        "A traditional or coupled CMS functions as one integrated system where the backend that stores content and product information is tethered to the frontend which is responsible for the layout.",
        "These systems often rely on a fixed framework as the code is usually attached to content or products on the backend.\u00a0",
        "This limits capabilities as developers are often restricted to certain frameworks, yet the design makes it relatively simple for novice users and startups to begin their digital presence with minimal work.",
        "In these designs, your products and content are usually managed by a tool (e.g. Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.) These tools provide authoring and preview option which help with authoring portion but they\u2019re heavily limited in delivery and layout options.",
        "A decoupled CMS has a separate backend but often integrates with a full frontend that ultimately pushes content into channels. While this makes content more agnostic, the frontend framework can limit delivery to certain channels, as with traditional CMS systems.",
        "A headless CMS removes the \u201chead\u201d which gives front-end developers the flexibility to pull content using an API to any endpoint. As the backend simply stores content, this prevents limitations to delivery caused by code in other designs.\u00a0",
        "In headless commerce architecture, developers can freely use content from the backend of a headless CMS and products stored in a headless commerce system.",
        "While this does typically remove marketing tools and preview capabilities, we offer solutions at Bloomreach that solve this problem by providing a \u201chead\u201d option that gives publishers the tools they need to effectively interact with content at any endpoint.",
        "\u00a0",
        "A lightweight API inherently enables the delivery of content stored in a backend system to far more channels than a \u201ctheme\u201d would provide as these are generally only optimized for specific endpoints.",
        "With a headless commerce architecture, the API can be used to pull information anywhere, including wearable tech, car commerce, IoT devices (e.g. smart appliances, TVs, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, etc.), kiosks, apps running on any platform, social networks, and more.",
        "",
        "This future-proof design essentially ensures that ecommerce delivery can scale to accommodate innovative products that will surface in the future.",
        "Unlike a setup designed for just content delivery, headless commerce architecture requires an inventory system to manage products.",
        "Inventory systems might connect with vendors, suppliers, or wholesalers, depending on the nature of the distribution network.",
        "Too, it might connect with company-owned distribution centers, allowing businesses to ship from local warehouses and save money.",
        "Businesses will also require additional backend systems for successful digital commerce. Organizations greatly increase sales through repeat business by tracking customer preferences with a CRM and using data science tools to better understand their customers.",
        "By building out a database and using analytics to investigate preferences and patterns, this provides insight allows businesses to better connect with existing customers as well as understand buying patterns for broader demographics.",
        "Of course, a secure payment system is necessary for selling on the web as well \u2013 some companies build their own, but most opt to integrate existing, secure platforms to handle payments.",
        "Once a transaction is complete, the API in a headless commerce architecture facilitates communication between inventory management, payment processing, the CRM, and certain other systems to update records accordingly.\u00a0",
        "The API in headless commerce architectures allows information to be shared seamlessly among systems for a true omnichannel retail environment.",
        "The main limitations rest on the shoulders of front-end developers\u2019 abilities to create a fitting user experience for each frontend. On the plus side, this means less development on the backend as the API in most designs can freely move data between a wide variety of existing systems.",
        "As such, headless commerce architecture works best with systems that use open databases that can be easily queried.",
        "Frontend developers can easily use this stripped-down information with frameworks like Angular or React.",
        "By using APIs such as those offered by Bloomreach, this solves the main problem of marketers being overly reliant on web developers to make edits for content or layout. This also removes the want or need to include a second, coupled CMS for WYSIWYG capabilities.\u00a0",
        "\u00a0",
        "There are 3 key differences between headless commerce and\u00a0legacy systems:\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Headless commerce let you\u00a0easily scale to reach new touchpoints \u00a0",
        "Frontend developers can pull content from backend systems with the API and use frameworks as they see fit for delivery and layout.",
        "When something new emerges or business decides to capitalize on an underutilized existing channel, developers can create custom delivery models to get content and products to these endpoints.",
        "\u00a0Headless commerce deliver content faster",
        "Despite having more systems in the mix for headless commerce, the API can be used to push and pull data, unencumbered by other processes or code.",
        "Frontends or optional \u201cheads\u201d use API calls to pull content needed and nothing more. Resources aren\u2019t shared, which is typically why coupled systems slow down during times of peak traffic.",
        "\u00a0\u00a0Headless commerce offer improved security",
        "In any networked environment, business systems should be as separate as possible with finely tuned access control lists (ACLs) to limit access from other systems or users.",
        "Headless commerce inherently relies on different systems working together, which eliminates the possibility of a compromised account wreaking complete havoc.",
        "\u00a0",
        "The greatest advantage that traditional commerce offers is rooted in the fact that everything is packaged together.",
        "Most systems are easy to set up and run using pre-included tools. However, this is also the biggest drawback of traditional (i.e. coupled) systems.",
        "Looking at the architecture for most traditional systems, there is a backend database that not only stores content but code for layout and other plugins used by the frontend of the system.",
        "This heavily limits the amount of customization that can be accomplished. While some elements can be edited or tweaked, this often comes with a cost as it is time-consuming and can lead to \u201cbreaks\u201d when a critical, underlying code is altered for design or functionality.",
        "\u00a0",
        "Because of the \u201call-inclusive\u201d design that defines traditional commerce systems, retailers and developers experience the following limitations:",
        "A traditional system is typically limited to the framework on which it is built. Developers are bound to corresponding toolsets which can hinder layout, delivery, and functionality.",
        "Admins and content creators all access the system through the same console which greatly increases data-related risks.",
        "While authors and editors accounts can be configured with limited privileges, breached accounts with elevated or full admin privileges could allow unauthorized users access to everything from content, customer records, payment information, and more.",
        "This is another area where a set framework hinders the commerce experience.",
        "Though themes and layout can be manually modified, the fact these systems rely on multiple layers of code means unintended consequences may happen as a result. This makes it far more difficult to properly deliver content to many channels.",
        "Developers can make plugins (or sometimes purchase pre-existing solutions) to interface with outside systems, but the experience usually isn\u2019t nearly as seamless as what an API in a headless commerce system can provide.",
        "Hence, some need to use another process \u2013 such as manual entry \u2013 to port inventory or customer information into the backend which can be time-consuming.",
        "\u00a0",
        "Headless commerce circumvents these problems by using the API as the core to interface with separate business systems.",
        "Admins can lockdown each system by only authorizing those who require access to any given machine as well as limit the amount of data available to the API.",
        "As there is no code intertwined with the backend database that stores content, frontend developers are free to adapt endpoint layout using the optimal framework.",
        "This means the content and products aren\u2019t restricted to just the sites or apps for which it\u2019s intended \u2013 a touchpoint can be any device connected to the web.",
        "",
        "Retailers can enjoy the advantages of true omnichannel design by developing custom layouts in much less time it takes to scale a coupled system to accomplish the same feat.",
        "This further accommodates A/B testing that can be analyzed against customer interaction to determine the most effective means for layout and functionality.",
        "When one design proves to convert more users into buyers, the less effective system can be decommissioned in favor of the better design.",
        "One of the only real disadvantages of a true headless system is the lack of available tools for marketers.",
        "This means that editing and previewing portions of content usually isn\u2019t possible without the aid of a developer which can slow down development teams.",
        "At Bloomreach, we solved the most glaring issue of headless commerce with the Bloomreach Experience Manager (brXM).",
        "This tool exists is part of our \u201chead optional\u201d design that puts more control in the hands of marketers by offering solutions for users to interact with content and portions of the headless platform without compromising delivery or security.",
        "\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Higher Expectations from Customers",
        "The modern era of business has brought many conveniences to the customer. As a consumer, the ability to access and enjoy whatever you desire can be accomplished with just a few clicks or taps.\n\n\"Customer expectations have increased regarding availability, frictionless shopping, product and service quality, and many other things,\" according to Dirk Hoerig.\u00a0",
        "This has put pressure on retailers and other businesses to deliver goods and services as quickly as possible which is why headless commerce is becoming a necessity.",
        "API-driven or API-based headless commerce was the top investment for 2019 mentioned by the companies and organizations that Gartner interviewed.",
        "",
        "\u00a0More Channels Available to Interact with Customers",
        "A great digital strategy for sellers involves reaching as many people through as many channels as possible.",
        "Headless commerce has the capability to deliver products and services directly to consumers in any format without the limitations plaguing traditional designs.",
        "Transitioning or expanding commerce with headless architecture enables businesses to reach a broader audience and substantially increase sales. Therefore, it's essential for businesses to shift to a headless commerce system.",
        "As Dirk Hoerig puts it, \"customer interaction drifted away from the desktop which was \u2013 for more than a decade \u2013 the only eCommerce sales channel. Shopping today is as mobile as the buyer, and is expected on practically every touchpoint.\"",
        "\u00a0Stay Ahead of Competitors",
        "\"These two changes required a completely different response from brands and retailers to stay competitive,\" says Dirk, \"Nowadays, retailers need to support more devices, provide outstanding and tailored customer experiences, and, last but not least, they have to become faster and more flexible with the technologies that enable all that. However, commerce platforms from the past are very inflexible as they were built to solve other challenges.",
        "\"The reason everyone\u2019s talking about headless is that the architecture allows the separation of commerce functionality and performance from the user experience, enabling companies to provide the best of breed shopping experiences to their customers.\"",
        "In the early days of ecommerce, virtually all traffic from buyers came from desktop systems.",
        "The systems that ran commerce sites were mostly of coupled (or traditional) designs, meaning the backend and frontend were closely tethered.",
        "Interdependent code didn\u2019t prove to be as much of a challenge as it is today \u2013 the most pressing issue for web developers involved making slight alterations to presentation elements to accommodate different browsers.",
        "",
        "Over the years several changes have come to technology that interfaces with the web \u2013 there are substantially more devices in circulation, the amount of data transmitted has increased, security is more robust, and there are far more ways to access information than just desktop browsers.",
        "Statistically speaking, you\u2019re likely reading this piece on a mobile device!\u00a0\ud83d\udcf1",
        "Headless commerce architecture allows a business to keep backend systems \u2013 such as the content management system (CMS), product inventory, customer relation management (CRM) system, payment processing, digital asset management (DAM) and others \u2013 separate from each other as well as the endpoints for layout.",
        "Even though a headless commerce system and its system separation can lead to increased complexity, it also offers multiple advantages such as:",
        "In a headless design, the API acts as the core of these systems and pulls the required information into different channels where it is optimized for layout.",
        "Headless commerce is a lightweight method for the transmission of data between systems, meaning this provides the best possible performance of any architecture.",
        "The days of one-size fits all delivery method for content and commerce are over \u2013 today\u2019s consumers access information from a wide variety of sources.",
        "This requires ecommerce retailers to adopt a system and process for true omnichannel delivery. As such, the topic of headless commerce vs traditional commerce becomes a serious matter for digital merchants.",
        "A headless system allows retailers to easily scale to deliver content and merchandise or services to multiple endpoints.",
        "A lightweight API controls the transmission of data between systems \u2013 content, products, customer information, financials, and other systems reside in separate systems, free from any code that limits frontend development.\u00a0",
        "Now let\u2019s look at a few scenarios where headless commerce helps businesses reach broader audiences.",
        "Appeals to value will change, depending on the geolocation, so messaging behind products or services need to match the intended audience.",
        "By creating subsets of page content for apps and sites in the backend of a headless CMS, this allows different, region-specific channels to pull matching messaging for any given audience.",
        "The resulting connection from tailored messaging increases successful conversion, meaning higher revenue.\u00a0",
        "While translating through Google or other translation engines can be helpful in a pinch, allowing these systems to translate professional web content usually produces a less than ideal outcome.",
        "For example, the English language often requires infinitive modifiers for verbs, so when software translates certain phrases to languages like French, the translation can be awkward.",
        "Headless commerce allows content creators to accurately translate languages prior to content distribution as well as encode content with the proper characters or alphabet.",
        "This is perhaps the most important feature of headless commerce as today there are extensive conversion opportunities found in many different devices and application.",
        "Of course, not all have the goal of completing a standard sale \u2013 some organizations are looking for followers (i.e. registered users) while others are simply looking to spread information.",
        "Endpoints can be adapted to funnel viewers into systems that provide them with the information or resources they\u2019re seeking from your organization.",
        "In many cases, businesses may use headless commerce with a decoupled kind of frontend or even with a traditional system.",
        "Businesses can also opt to make use of a coupled system on a specific channel as traditional systems make ideal endpoints in certain circumstances.",
        "Too, businesses can opt to use \u201chead optional\u201d systems like the Bloomreach Experience Manager (brXM) which allows marketers to interact with content, rather than solely relying on IT to make changes.",

        "The Covid-19 novel coronavirus outbreak has gone from a regional Chinese public health crisis to a global emergency very quickly.",
        "This is clearly a very dynamic situation, and while we all hope for a quick stabilization and decrease in both the rate of infection and mortality, we do not really know the length, spread, or impact of this virus.",
        "For business leaders this presents a whole host of important questions ranging from employee health, to addressing supply chain disruption, to consumer trust, to business continuity.",
        "Hopefully those challenges are short term, but for retailers and brands, what are the implications for eCommerce in the short-term and longer-term?\u00a0",
        "\n\n\u00a0",
        "If you sell relevant products to treat and prevent novel coronavirus, focus on what is most important to your customers right now:\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Ensure your product information is accurate.\u00a0Unfortunately there are lots of\u00a0misinformation and inaccurate\u00a0claims out there. Customers need to know the facts about products, down to very specific details like percentage of alcohol in a sanitizer or the molecule size that may pass through a mask or filter.\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Build relevant, fact-based and accurate content to advise customers.\u00a0Customers want to know both how effective they may be and how to use them to prevent infection. People are depending on you and these products for their health, and those they care for. Rich content and\u00a0relevant links\u00a0to medical and scientific authorities may be an important help, and that is true even if you do not sell and market relevant products.",
        "\u00a0Ensure these products are discoverable.\u00a0Not a surprise, but at Bloomreach we have seen a spike in sales across client sites in recent weeks, including masks +849%, hand sanitizers +420%, disinfectants +184%, and canned food +191%. Make sure your search is tuned and able to get people to the right products, and that you suppress products that are not appropriate.\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Ensure out of stock items are clearly marked and can not be ordered.\u00a0This seems obvious, but not all systems are as well integrated as they should be. Having these products still appear in search and category listings with \u201csold-out\u201d - and when you expect the back-order or resupply to become available - may be a better service to your customers than simply removing them, as it will save customers time and aggravation. And while it may seem anathema to common business practices, you can also consider the good will of helping customers find these products even if it is from a competitor\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Lastly, ensure fair market pricing is followed and delivery promise-dates are accurate.\u00a0This is a particular issue with marketplaces such as\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and others where you may not be in control of the pricing. Not only is this moral obligation, but also may put you on the wrong side of authorities.\u00a0",
        "If you do not sell relevant products to prevent and treat coronavirus, right now is a tricky time.\u00a0Consumers\u2019 minds are elsewhere and you need to market with sensitivity and empathy, while also maintaining a business.",
        "And of course, consumers are going to also enjoy a distraction or two, while filling lots of downtime as they change their routines and spend a lot more time working and relaxing at home.",
        "\u00a0",
        "Marketers and merchants can look to:",
        "\u00a0Connect with consumers around their home, family, neighbors, and close friends.\u00a0We will all be looking to fill time, and this kind of crisis has a way of connecting us to those in our immediate circles. Think about merchandising strategies that fulfill that need, maybe even a touch of nostalgia. We may all be able to use that right now.\n\n\u00a0Emphasize eCommerce.\u00a0It goes without saying that digital channels will now be paramount. Customers will be increasingly shopping from home, most likely from the couch or kitchen table (during their eighteenth conference call of the day as they work remote).",
        "Attention spans will be short, and people will be looking to both quickly find and buy essentials, while also filling time browsing and dreaming and gaining inspiration they may well impassively act on as they spend more time at home. Google and Amazon will be a natural starting point for these consumers as they start their digital journeys.",
        "Make sure you get your share and secure precious margin dollars by ensuring your digital experience is up to standard, your content well targeted, marketing and experience aligned and personalized, and search effective and relevant. eCommerce and digital marketing performance will be critical to not just your online numbers, but the company's overall results and earnings.",
        "Your CEO, your board, and your investors are most certainly paying attention to eCommerce now.\n\n\u00a0Reassure customers on the source and materials of your products.\u00a0The science here is still inconclusive, but consumers are naturally more concerned now over country-of-origin and the source of the products they are bringing into their homes or businesses.",
        "Marketplace sellers selling off-price and\u00a0insta-brands\u00a0from off-shore may be looked at - rightly or wrongly - differently by consumers now. Many retailers and brands are not consistent with this information on their digital channels. And it may be time to address that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Try to address concerns over how products will be delivered or picked up.\u00a0Trusted carriers and pickup options where \u2018social-distancing\u2019 and disinfection is respected will be important to many. Consider how you might implement these and reassure your customers through clear communication. I realize this is a challenge.",
        "\u00a0",
        "For businesses everywhere it is time to gameplan to address the long-term implications of the novel coronavirus, and that is most certainly true for retailers and brands where digital commerce channels will be critical moving forward. Consider that:",
        "\u00a0Changes in customer behavior will become even further entrenched.\u00a0The average modern human is already a digital junkie, and online research and shopping - and of course omnichannel behaviors - are already a routine part of our lives.",
        "But shopping in physical stores still makes up a majority of our spending, even today. That will certainly change short-term as \u2018Social distancing\u2019 recommendations become common and even routine local shopping trips and errands cause people to pause and consider if they really want to take the risk.",
        "This is certainly already true in areas already impacted by Covid-19, such as in the Seattle area - which is both where I live and where the virus has had it\u2019s most pronounced, tragic impact thus far in the United States.",
        "eCommerce is going to fill the gap - both shopping via mobile and desktop - for everything from pantry staples to the impulse buys we buy out of boredom or our daydreams. Home delivery may become a lifeline, just as it became in\u00a0China, and become the new norm for the average consumer in urban and suburban communities.",
        "For businesses without an effective digital commerce channel or a way to digitally engage their customers, this problem is now becoming a crisis. And implementing same-day courier based delivery and in-store pickup may become critical, depending on your category and store footprint.\n\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Amazon and other large aggregators take an even bigger piece of the pie.\u00a0Habits are hard to break, and when it comes to shopping online, Amazon takes a very large\u00a0share\u00a0of the pie. Look for Amazon to take a greater share of eCommerce and total retail sales, even as their marketplace suffers from the same supply chain challenges other businesses face.",
        "Their Chinese sellers and other offshore\u00a0insta-brands\u00a0will likely be impacted by the virus short-term, but their core retailing business will increasingly become a go-to destination for what consumers would otherwise purchase offline.",
        "This will be based on the strength of their prime program - now with an estimated\u00a0105 million members\u00a0in the U.S., which is a staggering 82% of households - as well as their fulfillment prowess, an assortment backed by their buying power, and relative value for the consumer. And of-course Amazon\u2019s sites and apps may not be sexy, but they sure work.",
        "They tick all the boxes for the \u2018digital commerce experience table stakes\u2019 and back-end operations.\u00a0Brands and retailers can\u2019t afford to allow Amazon any more ground.\u00a0Even if Amazon is a great channel for your business today, and you see a near-term benefit from more sales through that channel, this is very dangerous for the long-term as they commoditize, disintermediate, and co-opt your\u00a0brand position and product differentiation.",
        "It is time to ensure you have the ability to protect (and ideally grow) your market-share via eCommerce and not allow demand to aggregate any further to Amazon, Walmart, or Alibaba, Rakuten, etc. depending on your market.\u00a0\n\u00a0",
        "\u00a0Distressed retailers face the perfect storm.\u00a0Bear with me as I generalize; retailers are in trouble. Sure, there are some outliers doing well who serve niche markets or have a business model aimed at low margin and fast turn.",
        "But most retailers today over built their physical footprint over the last two decades and are now trapped with too many leases for stores whose performance was already lagging before the novel coronavirus hit. But now foot-fal* in all their stores is about to hit rock-bottom, and that means sales.",
        "That sound you hear is inventory turns grinding to a halt in every retail format except grocery. The majority of these retailers do not yet have effective or highly performant digital commerce channels, let alone effective omnichannel capabilities like buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS), and even if they do it today can not make up the gap.",
        "And to add to this perfect storm, the virus is impacting supply-chains either through supplier interruption or the chaos of trans-oceanic logistics happening right now. This may all unfortunately tip these retailers toward bankruptcy or closure, even before you factor in the general erosion in consumer confidence and spending as stock markets and retirement savings take a major hit and the economy tips toward recession or stagnation.",
        "If the impacts of the virus linger on the consumers shopping habits and sentiments, expect the real retail apocalypse to commence with a further round of bankruptcies aimed at shedding those leases and accelerating the pivot toward a more balanced omnichannel strategy. (And no, I do not think retail is dead, just significantly changed.)\n\u00a0",
        "\u00a0More experimentation in innovative digital experiences.\u00a0eCommerce and rapid, reliable fulfillment is sure damn convenient. And while we may enjoy the \u2018gifts to ourselves\u2019 when packages arrive, is it really as fun as the serendipitous, spontaneous shopping experience when we find that cool special thing?",
        "I really don\u2019t think so, and I do not even enjoy shopping that much (there is a reason why I jumped at the chance to work in eCommerce as soon as it was a thing). And certainly there are some key demographics with major spending power who still see shopping as entertainment and love the feeling it gives them to be waited on by a great salesperson.",
        "And yes, there are some things you want to feel, try on, and kick the tires of before you buy. But that may very well be an experience we have less and less of for a while. Expect an increasing amount of rich content, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) experiments as marketers try to fill that void.",
        "Expect more novelty digital innovations and creative \u2018channels\u2019, like social buying and shopping streams. Many of these experiments may prove to be useless, but who knows, maybe there is an Interwebs in there somewhere.\u00a0",
        "We all hope that the measures being taken across the globe today slows the rate of infection and thus mortality. We all hope medical research will find a way to heal all those already impacted with available treatments.",
        "And we all hope a vaccine for Covid-19 novel coronavirus is discovered and scaled quickly and made available to all who need it across the globe. That said, this\u00a0\u2018black swan\u2019\u00a0could bring real shifts in how customers rely on and use digital commerce.",
        "We would be wise to prepare now for the impacts on businesses to both survive and hopefully thrive as a result.\u00a0",
