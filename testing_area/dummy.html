After his widowed mother lost all of their money in the financial crash of 1907, his family fell into poverty. Yet, Graham turned this around. Studying at Columbia University, he went on to work at Wall Street, going from clerk to analyst to partner before running his own investment partnership. Consequently, he amassed a wealth of historical and psychological knowledge concerning the financial markets, that spanned several decades. And he shared that knowledge in his book, The Intelligent Investor.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><img alt=\"intelligent investor\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-227952 size-full\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disen\u0303o-sin-ti\u0301tulo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disen\u0303o-sin-ti\u0301tulo.jpg 800w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disen\u0303o-sin-ti\u0301tulo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disen\u0303o-sin-ti\u0301tulo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Disen\u0303o-sin-ti\u0301tulo-450x300.jpg 450w\" width=\"800\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In \u2018The Intelligent Investor,\u2019 little time is spent discussing the technique of analyzing securities. Instead, great focus is placed on investment principles and investors\u2019 attitudes. Although \u2018The Intelligent Investor\u2019 was first published in 1949, the underlying principles of good investment do not change from decade to decade. Consequently, in \u2018The Intelligent Investor,\u2019 Benjamin Graham aims to teach us three things:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to minimize the chances of suffering irreversible losses</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to maximize the chance of achieving sustainable wins</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to overcome self-defeating modes of thought that often prevent investors from reaching their full potential</span></li><br></ol><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To be an intelligent investor, you must be patient, disciplined, and eager to learn new things. You must also be able to control your emotions and to think for yourself. Graham states that the intelligence needed to be a good investor has much more to do with character than it does IQ. Throughout this \u2018The Intelligent Investor\u2019 summary, we shall explore some of the key investment takeaways, and the Benjamin Graham formula for smart, successful investing.</span></p><br><div class=\"bg-white py-12 px-8 -mx-8 my-12 md:py-16 md:px-24 md:-mx-24\" x-data=\"oberlo.authProvider.data()\" x-init=\"oberlo.authProvider.init\" x-show=\"!isLoggedIn\"><br><div class=\"flex flex-col items-center space-y-12 sm:space-y-0 sm:flex-row-reverse\"><br><figure class=\"sm:ml-6 md:ml-12 flex-shrink-0\"><br><img alt=\"\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://www.oberlo.com/media/1598449754-brain-with-oberlo.png?dpr=0.5\" srcset=\"https://www.oberlo.com/media/1598449754-brain-with-oberlo.png 2x\" width=\"237\"/><br></figure><br><div class=\"flex flex-col items-start space-y-12 sm:space-y-6\"><br><p>Don\u2019t wait for someone else to do it.

According to Graham, intelligent investing consists of three things:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A thorough analysis of a company and the soundness of its business practices before the purchase of any of its stock</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making sure that you are protected against any severe losses</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not aspiring to extraordinary results, but aiming for \u201cadequate\u201d performance</span></li><br></ol><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For an intelligent investor, money isn\u2019t made simply by \u201cfollowing the market,\u201d i.e., buying a stock, because its value has gone up, or selling a stock because its value has waned. Graham argues that the exact opposite is true, positing that stocks become riskier the more their value increases and vice versa.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whereas an investor believes the market price is judged by established standards of value, a speculator bases all of their standards of value on the market price, which is a significant difference. An excellent way to check if the market is swaying your value-judgments is to ask yourself whether you would be happy to invest in a particular stock if you were unable to know its market price. That way, you have to rely on your intuition.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For this reason, it\u2019s vital to point out that, unlike the speculator, the intelligent investor isn\u2019t investing for quick wins. The only way to reach long-term investment goals is to make sustainable and reliable decisions that are not subject to the whims of the often volatile stock market.\u00a0</span></p><br><h3 id=\"investment-and-inflation\"><span id=\"Investment_and_Inflation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Investment and Inflation</span><b>\u00a0</b></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227938\" height=\"530\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1427751840561-9852520f8ce8.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1427751840561-9852520f8ce8.jpeg 800w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1427751840561-9852520f8ce8-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1427751840561-9852520f8ce8-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1427751840561-9852520f8ce8-450x298.jpeg 450w\" width=\"800\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To understand inflation, we have to look at how it has fluctuated throughout time. When armed with the historical data, it\u2019s clear to see that while interest rates do oscillate, the overall trend is that interest generally increases over time. However, forecasting what the interest rate is going to look like in the future is risky. We can never know for sure what the figure will be in the future, but it might be worth considering the interest rates of the previous 20 years, and using them as a springboard to forecast what might be probable in the future.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nevertheless, just because the future is uncertain doesn\u2019t mean that we should put all of our investments in either bonds or stocks purely because of the attractiveness of their current interest rate. The more an investor begins to rely on the income gained from their portfolio, the greater their need to protect themselves from the unexpected. This means investing in the broader spread of both bonds and stocks.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since \u2018The Intelligent Investor\u2019 was first published, two additional investment options have become available that protect investors from the risks of inflation. These are:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts): Companies that own and collect rent from both residential and commercial properties.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities): US government bonds that automatically increase in value as inflation rises.</span></li><br></ul><br><h3 id=\"a-century-of-stock-market-history\"><span id=\"A_century_of_stock-market_history\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A century of stock-market history</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227947\" height=\"1187\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1580287312950-e83b6d03eee5.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1580287312950-e83b6d03eee5.jpeg 800w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1580287312950-e83b6d03eee5-202x300.jpeg 202w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1580287312950-e83b6d03eee5-690x1024.jpeg 690w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1580287312950-e83b6d03eee5-768x1140.jpeg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1580287312950-e83b6d03eee5-450x668.jpeg 450w\" width=\"800\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the time of writing the reupdated version of \u201cThe Intelligent Investor,\u201d it was 1973, and Benjamin Graham had managed to predict the disastrous bear market of 1973-74 in which US stocks lost 37 percent of their value. However, he unequivocally states that the intelligent investor doesn\u2019t rely exclusively on historical data to predict the future.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To prevent us from taking such a purely historical-focused approach, Graham posits that we ask ourselves the following questions:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why should future returns always match past returns?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If each investor believes that certain stocks are guaranteed to make money in the long-run, then doesn\u2019t that mean that the market will end up becoming overpriced?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If this is the case, then how is it possible for future returns to be high?</span></li><br></ol><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Graham points out, to use a market\u2019s recent good returns as a platform from which to project future returns is risky; no stock can perform consistently well for all time. However, many investors fall into the trap of buying high because a stock seems secure, and then selling low when the stock inevitably falters. To counteract this phenomenon, we should adopt the Benjamin Graham formula that suggests we use the \u201crule of opposites\u201d which posits that the more enthusiastic investors become about a stock option in the long-run, the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short-run.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ultimately, Graham states that the only thing an investor can be sure about when attempting to forecast future stock returns, is that they will probably turn out to be wrong. The singular truth that history teaches us is that the future is unpredictable. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s the people who seem to be the most certain about how the future will turn out that are the most surprised when it proves otherwise. Therefore, the key is to remain humble about your abilities to predict the future to prevent you from risking too much on it.</span></p><br><h3 id=\"the-active-and-the-defensive-investor\"><span id=\"The_active_and_the_defensive_investor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The active and the defensive investor</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227953\" height=\"533\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1551135049-8a33b5883817.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1551135049-8a33b5883817.jpeg 800w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1551135049-8a33b5883817-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1551135049-8a33b5883817-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1551135049-8a33b5883817-450x300.jpeg 450w\" width=\"800\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The aggressiveness of your portfolio depends less on the kinds of investments you make, and more on the type of investor you are. Benjamin Graham states that there are two ways to be an intelligent investor:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To continually research, choose, and observe a mix of bonds, mutual funds, and stocks. Graham refers to this as the \u201cactive\u201d or \u201centerprising\u201d approach. It requires a lot of time and energy.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To create a permanent portfolio that requires minimal further effort on your behalf and that runs on autopilot, but that doesn\u2019t generate a lot of excitement as a result. Graham refers to this as the \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cdefensive\u201d approach.</span></li><br></ol><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Both approaches are equally smart, but your success in either one of them requires you to know which approach better suits your personality. This is because you will need to stick with this approach for your entire investment lifetime and be able to keep both your emotions and your costs in check. For example, if you have plenty of time, are competitive, and enjoy an intellectual challenge, you might make for a better active investor. If, however, you don\u2019t particularly enjoy thinking about money and prioritize a feeling of calm, you might be better suited to being a defensive investor.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a defensive investor, you don\u2019t alter your investment practices simply because your life circumstances change. Central to the Benjamin Graham formula of intelligent investing is to replace all guesswork and market predictions with discipline.</span></p><br><h3 id=\"the-defensive-investor-and-common-stocks\"><span id=\"The_defensive_investor_and_common_stocks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The defensive investor and common stocks</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227934\" height=\"853\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280-880x586.jpg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analysis-1841158_1280-450x300.jpg 450w\" width=\"1280\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Graham posits that how defensive you should be as an investor depends on how much time and energy you are willing to put into developing your portfolio. Still, given the volatility of the stock market, why would a defensive investor ever invest in stocks as opposed to bonds? Because, as Graham mentioned in chapter two, due to the risk of inflation, to invest entirely in either stocks or bonds is to make yourself vulnerable. It, therefore, doesn\u2019t matter how defensive an investor you are, you should always keep at least a portion of your money in stocks.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the biggest challenges that a defensive investor must combat is the belief that they can pick stocks without doing a lot of research beforehand. It\u2019s essential that a sense of familiarity with a company doesn\u2019t replace researching the company\u2019s financial statements. As psychologists at the Carnegie Mellon University showed, the more familiar an individual feels they are with a subject, the more likely they are to exaggerate how much they know about it.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This phenomenon can be seen in the likes of a countless number of investors buying shares in Amazon.com simply because they frequently used its services. By replacing familiarity with thorough research, these investors failed to see that the stocks they were buying were overpriced. Therefore, the more familiar a stock is, the more likely it is to turn an intelligent defensive investor into a complacent one.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a defensive investor, it\u2019s also essential not to become excited by new market fluctuations that could induce a rash investment decision. The way a defensive investor both participates in and wins the race is by sitting still. According to Graham\u2019s \u201cdollar-cost averaging\u201d approach, a defensive investor will regularly put a fixed amount of money into a particular investment, regardless of how the markets are performing in any given week. Indeed, a defensive investor may even decide to purchase their stocks via a broker or a financial planner. However, to stick to Graham\u2019s mantra of avoiding complacency, the defensive investor must investigate whether such an adviser should be trusted beforehand.</span></p><br><h3 id=\"portfolio-policy-for-the-aggressive-investor-the-negative-side\"><span id=\"Portfolio_policy_for_the_aggressive_investor_the_negative_side\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Portfolio policy for the aggressive investor </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the negative side</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227960\" height=\"853\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280-880x586.jpg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dices-over-newspaper-2656028_1280-450x300.jpg 450w\" width=\"1280\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Benjamin Graham argues that for both the defensive and the aggressive investor, what you don\u2019t do is just as important as what you do. In this chapter, Graham highlights some absolute essentials for those wanting to take the aggressive investor route.

They are as follows:</span></p><br><h4><span id=\"1_Investing_in_a_relatively_unpopular_large_company\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. Investing in a relatively unpopular large company</span></span></h4><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227957\" height=\"905\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280-300x212.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280-768x543.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280-880x622.jpg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/entrepreneur-1340649_1280-450x318.jpg 450w\" width=\"1280\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If we can take it as a given that the market habitually overvalues common stocks that have been showing remarkable growth, we can assume that it undervalues companies that are not performing quite as well. The key here is for the intelligent investor to locate the larger companies that are going through a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">temporary</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> period of uncertainty.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indeed, the intelligent investor should only become interested in a significant growth stock, not when it\u2019s at its most popular, but when something goes wrong. This strategy gives investors the opportunity to, as Graham puts it, buy stocks in a \u201crelatively unpopular large company\u201d that are being sold at a meager price.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take, for example, Johnson &amp; Johnson, who in 2002, announced that federal regulators were investigating its books after claims of false record-keeping. This false record-keeping caused its stock to drop a considerable 16 percent in a single day. Smart investors bought up these stocks. When the company returned to its former standing, they\u2019d made quite a bit of money.\u00a0</span></p><br><h4><span id=\"2_Purchasing_bargain_issues\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Purchasing bargain issues</span></span></h4><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A bargain issue is a stock or bond that seems to be worth at least 50 percent more than what it\u2019s selling for. To work out if an issue is a bargain, you must first attempt to estimate whether the stock\u2019s future earnings outweigh the costs of the issue currently causing it to be undervalued. Secondly, you must evaluate the value of the business to a private owner which, again, is primarily worked out by projecting future earning potential. Graham refers to this approach as having courage within a depressed market by using the wisdom of value analysis.</span></p><br><h4><span id=\"3_Special_situations\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3.

To make such an acquisition possible, and to get the shareholders of the smaller company onboard, the stocks are nearly always offered at a price considerably higher than the current price. Therefore, any investor smart enough to purchase shares or bonds in a company that is perhaps nearing bankruptcy, and thus selling cheaply, but that may have a chance of being bought out and increasing its stock value, could make a lot of money.\u00a0</span></p><br><h3 id=\"the-investor-and-market-fluctuations\"><span id=\"The_investor_and_market_fluctuations\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The investor and market fluctuations</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227943\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834.jpeg 1350w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834-880x587.jpeg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1513596846216-48ae70153834-450x300.jpeg 450w\" width=\"1350\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the majority of the time, the market accurately prices stocks, but occasionally, the price is significantly wrong. Graham explains why by conjuring up an image of the market as being \u201cMr. Market;\u201d a frantic investor who pays too much for stocks when they are doing well and desperately tries to get rid of them when their price falls. It\u2019s, therefore, important that the intelligent investor can view the market as a fallible, emotion-driven entity, that shouldn\u2019t be blindly trusted, even though most people do.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While it\u2019s undoubtedly a good idea to observe how the market is behaving, the intelligent investor should behave in a way that serves their interests, without getting caught up in the pull of dramatic market fluctuations. Graham argues that one of the great advantages of being an individual investor is that you can think for yourself. By allowing yourself to get lost in the behavior of the market, you forgo your greatest asset; objective, critical thought. While you can\u2019t control how the market changes over time, you can control the following:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your brokerage costs (by trading seldomly, cheaply, and with patience)</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your ownership costs (by rejecting mutual funds with high annual expenses)</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your expectations (by grounding your return predictions in reality, not fantasy)</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your risk (by diversifying, rebalancing, and choosing how many of your assets to put in the market)</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your tax bills (by holding all of your stocks for a minimum of a year, and if possible, five years to keep your capital-gains liability low)</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your\u00a0 behavior</span></li><br></ul><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Investing isn\u2019t about beating others in an investment game; it\u2019s about controlling your behavior and being in charge of your own game. If you\u2019re planning on investing for at least 25 to 30 years, then the most logical investment approach is to buy every month automatically and to buy more whenever you get some extra money. The stock market is the best option for such a lifelong investment, and this type of meticulous, automatic investment, means that you are less likely to be tempted to make rash, volatile, market-driven decisions.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If stocks are doing well, you buy, if they fall, you buy, and over time, your investments will begin to add up steadily. Graham states that it would be better if we couldn\u2019t see a market quotation for our stocks at all as then we would be spared the anguish caused by \u201cother persons\u2019 mistakes of judgment.\u201d By putting your portfolio on autopilot, you avoid the mood swings of \u201cMr. Market\u201d and can focus instead on your long-term financial goals.</span></p><br><h3 id=\"investing-in-investment-funds\"><span id=\"Investing_in_investment_funds\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Investing in investment funds</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227959\" height=\"522\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280-300x122.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280-1024x418.jpg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280-768x313.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280-880x359.jpg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/analytics-3265840_1280-450x184.jpg 450w\" width=\"1280\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though mutual funds make investing seem easy and affordable, they come with their problems. They often underperform, overcharge, and behave erratically. The intelligent investor must, therefore, choose very carefully before investing in a mutual fund. A group of financial scholars that studied mutual funds for half a century concluded that mutual funds tend to behave under the following:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They do not choose stocks well enough to cover the costs of researching and trading them.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The higher a mutual fund\u2019s expenses, the lower its returns.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The more frequently a mutual fund trades, the lower its returns.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mutual funds that are more volatile than others and are likely to remain volatile.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mutual funds that had high returns in the past are unlikely to keep these high returns for long.</span></li><br></ul><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, armed with this knowledge concerning the fallibility of mutual funds, the intelligent investor is better equipped to discern a more solid mutual fund from a more volatile one. Further, mutual funds offer the intelligent investor an excellent means of diversifying their portfolio and freeing them up to do things besides endlessly analyzing the market and picking their stocks.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In general, an index fund that owns all the stocks in the market at any one time will beat the most selective funds in the long-run. While this isn\u2019t a particularly exciting way to invest, if you can hold an index fund for 20 years or more, you\u2019ll likely outperform the majority of professional and individual investors alike. Graham and Warren Buffett both agree that index funds are the single best choice for individual intelligent investors.</span></p><br><h3 id=\"the-intelligent-investor-and-their-advisors\"><span id=\"The_intelligent_investor_and_their_advisors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The intelligent investor and their advisors</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227955\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paper-3213924__480.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paper-3213924__480.jpg 761w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paper-3213924__480-300x189.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/paper-3213924__480-450x284.jpg 450w\" width=\"761\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many investors take comfort from the second opinion of an excellent financial advisor. Whether it\u2019s to get advice on the rate of returns or to have someone to blame when things go wrong, having an advisor can prove an essential asset in the intelligent investor\u2019s arsenal. Indeed, there are specific scenarios in which seeking out an advisor might prove even more beneficial; these include:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If your portfolio loses a significant amount of its value.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you struggle to keep and maintain a personal budget and are barely able to make ends meet, let alone begin saving.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When your portfolio is over-diversified to the point of being completely chaotic.\u00a0</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019ve recently gone through a significant life change, such as becoming self-employed, or if you need to look after your aging parents.</span></li><br></ul><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet, before you choose your advisor, you must first try to ascertain if you can trust them, and then you need to investigate and verify their credentials. When you find a match, a good financial advisor will be able to establish:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A comprehensive financial plan</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An investment policy statement</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An asset-allocation plan</span></li><br></ul><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All three of these facets are the fundamentals from which reliable financial decisions are made, you must create them together.

This quality requires the intelligent investor to look at least five years\u2019 worth of the company\u2019s annual reports and to answer two questions: Where are the company\u2019s profits coming from, and what is making this company grow?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The quality of a company\u2019s management. A good company\u2019s management will do what they say they will. They should be honest about their failures and take responsibility for them.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The financial strength and structure of the company\u2019s capital. Whether the company produces more cash than it consumes, and the managers reinvest this money to grow profits further.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The company\u2019s dividend record. Research the previous ten years of dividends history. If dividends have increased at a steady average of at least six to seven percent over the past ten years, that\u2019s a good sign.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The company\u2019s current dividend rate.</span></li><br></ol><br><h3 id=\"things-to-consider-about-per-share-earnings\"><span id=\"Things_to_consider_about_per-share_earnings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Things to consider about per-share earnings</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227965\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280-300x158.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280-768x405.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280-880x464.jpg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/puzzle-2500328_1280-450x237.jpg 450w\" width=\"1280\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The intelligent investor is aware of the lengths to which top executives and accountants occasionally go to make themselves very rich at the expense of the company and its shareholders. There are plenty of ways that financial reporting and \u201ccreative accounting\u201d has made companies seem more financially attractive than they are.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, pro forma earnings originally aimed at projecting an honest picture of long-term earnings growth by accounting for short-term deviations and nonrecurring events. A pro forma statement might show how much a company could have made over the previous year if the company they just acquired had been with them for that entire year.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, pro forma earnings can also be used in a more corrupt manner with companies showing how well they might have done if they hadn\u2019t made such bad investment decisions. For example, in 2001, JDS Uniphase Corps presented its pro forma earnings as if it hadn\u2019t paid $4 million in taxes, lost $7 million in bad stocks, and as if it hadn\u2019t incurred $2.5 billion in merger and goodwill chargers. The intelligent investor will, therefore, ignore any pro forma earnings reports.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies may also prematurely recognize revenue that hasn\u2019t entered its accounts yet, i.e., projecting yearly revenue based on the number of products produced and expected to sell, before they\u2019ve sold. However, there are a few things the intelligent investor can do to try to ascertain whether the company they are about to invest in has a few red flags in its accounting methods:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Read backwards\u2013When reading a company\u2019s financial reports, start on the last page, and read towards the beginning. Nearly everything a company won\u2019t want you to read will be found in the back of the report.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Read the notes\u2013Always read the footnotes of the financial statement\u2019s found in the annual report. Be sure to compare the footnotes to at least one firm that\u2019s a close competitor.\u00a0</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Read more\u2013Especially if you are an enterprising investor, it\u2019s wise to try to learn as much as possible about financial reporting to reduce the risk of you being misled by a dubious earnings statement.</span></li><br></ol><br><h3 id=\"stock-selection-for-the-defensive-investor\"><span id=\"Stock_selection_for_the_defensive_investor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stock selection for the defensive investor</span></span></h3><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By definition, the defensive investor takes a low-risk, long-term approach to investing. The best tool invented for such low-maintenance stock investing is a low-cost index fund. However, some defensive investors do enjoy the intellectual challenge of picking some individual stocks. When this is the case, it\u2019s advised that the defensive investor keeps 90 percent of their shares in an index fund, leaving ten percent to be invested in the stock market at will. To help defensive investors make smart stock investment decisions, Graham proposes the following criteria for stock selection:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adequate size. When Graham first wrote \u2018The Intelligent Investor,\u2019 he stated it was advisable to avoid investing in smaller companies. However, with the option to buy into mutual funds that specialize in small stocks today, it can also make financial sense to buy into smaller companies by way of a small company index fund.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strong financial condition. Graham defines financial strength as a diversified portfolio of stocks that\u2019s current assets are at least double its current liabilities, and that\u2019s long-term debt doesn\u2019t exceed working capital.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Earnings stability. A stock is strong if it has some earnings on the common stock in each of the previous ten years.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dividend record. Look for companies that pay dividends and that have a history of doing so.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moderate P/E ratio. Only choose stocks whose current price is no more than 15 times the average earnings over the past three years.</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moderate price-to-book ratio. Multiply the P/E ratio by the price-to-book ratio. If the number is below 22.5, it\u2019s likely to be a reasonably priced stock.</span></li><br></ol><br><h3 id=\"stock-selection-for-the-enterprising-investor\"><span id=\"Stock_selection_for_the_enterprising_investor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stock selection for the enterprising investor</span></span></h3><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For most investors, picking individual stocks is inadvisable. Even most professionals do a lousy job. While a small percentage of investors do well at picking their own stocks, the majority would do better to invest defensively, in an index fund. However, for those who want to give enterprising investment a shot, Graham suggests to practice first, by spending a year tracking and picking stocks, but not investing any money. This way, you learn without incurring any significant debt.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if you had put your money in an index fund. If you found the process exhausting, or you picked bad stocks, it might be worth considering becoming a defensive investor. If, however, you enjoyed the process and made some good returns, Graham suggests assembling a selection of stocks, but limiting them to only ten percent of your entire portfolio. The rest should be invested in an index fund.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you decide to invest this ten percent in the market, then you should look for stocks and industries that are temporarily unfashionable and, thus, offer the potential for big gains once the public perception changes. By checking comparable businesses, or the prices that similar such companies have been acquired for over the years, you can get a good idea of how much a company may be worth.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next, it\u2019s essential to look at who is running the company and to ask yourself: Are the company\u2019s financial statements understandable, or are they full of unclear jargon? Good managers communicate a company\u2019s current status-quo clearly and honestly. Another red flag is if a manager talks more about the stock price than the business. These are signs that a company isn\u2019t performing as well as it may appear.</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Above all, an enterprising investor must be both disciplined and consistent, resist changing their approach even when it seems unfashionable, and they should only focus on what they are doing, not what the market is doing.</span></p><br><h3 id=\"margin-of-safety-as-the-central-concept-of-investment\"><span id=\"Margin_of_safety_as_the_central_concept_of_investment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Margin of safety as the central concept of investment</span></span></h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-227966\" height=\"754\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" src=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280.jpg 1280w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280-300x177.jpg 300w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280-1024x603.jpg 1024w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280-768x452.jpg 768w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280-880x518.jpg 880w, https://wp-en.oberlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calculator-385506_1280-450x265.jpg 450w\" width=\"1280\"/></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Losing money is an inevitability of investing. To be a smart investor, you need to ensure that you never lose the majority, or all, of your money. To give yourself a buffer, Graham suggests that you refuse to pay too much for an investment and, therefore, minimize the chances of your wealth completely disappearing. As he has repeated throughout the book, the greatest risk to our financial health isn\u2019t the stocks, but ourselves. Risk resides not in the market, but in what kind of an investor we are.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the Nobel-prize-winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman, we often fall prey to two modes of thinking when making a decision:</span></p><br><ol><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well-calibrated confidence (do I understand this investment as well as I think I do?)</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Correctly-anticipated regret (how much will I regret it if my analysis turns out to be wrong?)</span></li><br></ol><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To check whether your confidence is well-calibrated, consider asking yourself the following questions:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is my track record with making similar decisions?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is the track record of other people who\u2019ve made similar decisions like?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If I am buying, it means someone else is selling. How probable is it that I know something that the seller doesn\u2019t know?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If I am selling, someone else is buying. How probable is it that I know something that the buyer doesn\u2019t know?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How much does this investment need to go up by before I break even (including taxes and the costs of trading)?</span></li><br></ul><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To assess whether you are correctly anticipating your regrets, ask yourself:</span></p><br><ul><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Based on the historical performance of similar investments, how much money might I stand to lose?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do I have other investments that could tide me over if this decision turns out to be bad?\u00a0</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Am I putting too much of my capital at risk with this investment?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Have I ever lost a lot of money on an investment before? How did it feel? Did I buy more, or did I bail out?</span></li><br><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Am I in control of my behavior, or am I relying on willpower to prevent me from panicking at the wrong time?</span></li><br></ul><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In conclusion, the probability of you making a bad investment during your investment-lifetime is 100 percent guaranteed. Graham is, therefore, adamant that the intelligent investor has ensured themselves against any losses that a bad investment may accrue. Many investors are so sure that they are right, they do little to protect themselves against the consequences of being wrong, and this is fatal for an investor.\u00a0</span></p><br><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, by making sure your portfolio is permanently diversified, and that the fluctuations of the market never influence you, you can ensure that the fallout from your bad investment decisions will never be a total disaster. This means that you can continue investing with regularity, patience, and calm, as you gradually work your way towards your long-term financial goals.</span></p><br><p>You can buy the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VVHPSZC\">Amazon</a>.</p><br><h2 id=\"want-to-learn-more\"><span id=\"Want_to_Learn_More\">Want to Learn More?</span></h2><br><ul><br><li><a href=\"/blog/financial-freedom\">10 Step Formula to Financial Freedom</a></li><br><li><a href=\"/blog/rich-dad-poor-dad\">Rich Dad Poor Dad Book Summary</a></li><br><li><a href=\"/blog/good-to-great\">Good to Great Book Summary</a></li><br><li><a href=\"/blog/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people\">How to Win Friends and Influence People Book Summary</a></li><br></ul><br><p>\u00a0</p><br><div class=\"mt-16\"><br><div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div><br><br></div><br></div>"
